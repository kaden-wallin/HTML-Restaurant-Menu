        <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Six individual bowls containing herbs pertaining to Thai cuisine">
        <p>The first location open was inside of the Amazon warehouse. Original the owner was just an employee of amazon who would share lunch with their friends, eventually people got to talking. So many others wanted to have some food there was a line out the warehouse door to get some. When food started to run out before people could get a bite, many would try paying for a place in line. The owner thought the money would make better use in their pocket and decided to open up a restaurant.</p><!-- About page code here -->
